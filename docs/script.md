Script
=========

Katamari-type object collision
	- how to decide where objects collide? (full rendered player?)
Game over for objects that are "too big" and no "ghost pills" left
	- each object has a weight, player has a max weight
Possession




Ideas
--------
Stone feet?
Action buttons?
Parts of a pill?


Presentation
=============
Been playing a lot of mario
Object collision!
Ghost - 
	Everything becomes "x-rayish"
	You are detached from your body, which still takes damage!
		-originally, whole body became ghost...
	You can float freely, no jumping
	You can go through MOST objects
		- not the ground yet (result in weird possession circumstances)
		- not the static background
	When you go through an object < certain weight, you can POSSESS it
		- should it require a pill to go back?
	Ghost mid-jump? Do you conserve momentum?
	Ghost should have less friction!

Click events
	- throwing items/shooting guns while human

Game physics
	- jumping, object collision
	- originally, tranforming back to human mid-air
	- still need free-falling damage
	- shooting/throwing items
	- CHANGING GRAVITY



Other ghosts
	- what happens when they collide with you???
